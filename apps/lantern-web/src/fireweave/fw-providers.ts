/**
 * fw-providers.ts — scaffolded by `/fireweave:initialise` (WEB / browser surface).
 *
 * `makeConnectedVendorProvider()` hands build-baked `PUBLIC_FW_PROJECT_API_KEY`
 * + `PUBLIC_FW_API_URL` to `initFireweave()` from `@fireweaveai/web-sdk`, which
 * prefetches a decision cache from fw-server (`POST /v1/flags/evaluate`) once
 * per context. Reads afterwards are a pure in-memory lookup and stay
 * SYNCHRONOUS — safe inside a render path.
 *
 * **The SDK reads no environment at all** (spec/modes.md) — credentials are
 * resolved by `resolveFireweaveWebCredentials` below (`PUBLIC_FW_*` is a BUILD
 * convention, Vite inlines it at bundle time; it is not a wire contract) and
 * passed in explicitly. The key is a Fireweave PROJECT key, public by
 * construction — never a secret. No direct vendor SDK for control points.
 *
 * `mode` is REQUIRED and never inferred (spec/modes.md): a missing credential
 * fails loudly at boot rather than silently degrading to local evaluation.
 *
 * After auth, call `syncFireweaveUser(userId, props)` — ONE `client.identify`
 * call that registers the user for DURABLE targeting AND re-prefetches the
 * decision cache under the new id, so sticky % ramps bucket on a stable id.
 *
 * Two kinds of property feed a rule and you need both:
 *   - DURABLE — registered once at sign-in (plan, beta membership, region).
 *     Stored server-side; rules keep matching without the app resending them.
 *   - PER-REQUEST — the per-call evaluation context. Overrides the registered
 *     value for that one evaluation.
 * A rule targeting a property that is never registered AND never sent matches
 * nobody, silently.
 *
 * Observability is NOT wired here. FireWeave does not take responsibility for
 * wiring an observability SDK into a repo that has not chosen one.

 * the app's concern and only the app knows where it may persist one.
 *
